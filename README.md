CraftCoin (CRC)
===============

#####Mandatory update to v1.2.0.0 required before Jan 31st, 2014 @ 00:00:00 UTC

CraftCoin is a cryptocurrency based on Litecoin. CraftCoin was designed to be a portable in-game currency for 
Minecraft servers. The currency is used to buy in-game items on minecraft servers, and can be instantly transferred
to any other Minecraft server that supports CraftCoin.  The reason this coin was made is: Prior to the spike in value 
of LTC, I ran a successful Minecraft server that used LTC as an in-game currency. The sudden spike in value caused a 
"bank run" and suddenly people stopped playing on the server due to hyper-inflation. This coin aims to solve this 
problem, since the value of a CraftCoin will be based on what players are willing to pay for in-game items, rather than
being tied to a coin with fluctuating value. CraftCoin is not intended to be a competitor with Bitcoin, Litecoin, or 
any other currency. Its one and only purpose is simply being a game currency that is protected from wild price swings 
that cause inflation/deflation on minecraft servers, and yet remains portable across any group of servers that wish to
adopt the currency.

I will be preparing a package for people to download all of the necessary software and plugins to implement CRC on 
their own Minecraft servers soon. Please check back soon.

**New parameters starting block 32000**
* 1 Minute blocktime target (Faster transactions!)
* 2 Coins per block (Adjusted for faster blocks, same targeted payout per hour as before)
* 100,000,000 Total Coins (unchanged)
* Difficulty Adjustment Every 60 Blocks (1 hour) sampling last 240 blocks (4 hours)
* Reduced max diff adjustment to 25% (from 100% previously)

These changes should result in a more stable, faster blockchain.
